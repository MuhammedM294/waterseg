## Project Description <a name="ProjectDescription"></a>

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify the water bodies of Toushka Lakes. The segmentation task involves classifying each pixel in satellite imagery as either water or non-water. This information can be valuable for various applications, such as environmental monitoring, water resource management, and urban planning.

The U-Net architecture is chosen for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder path that captures contextual information and a decoder path that enables precise localization. The PyTorch framework provides a powerful and flexible environment for building and training deep learning models.
