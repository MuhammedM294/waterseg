# WaterSeg: Lake Toushka Waterbodies Segmentation
==============================

This project aims to perform waterbodies segmentation of Toushka Lakes, a chain of lakes in southern Egyptâ€™s New Valley. The ambitious Toshka Lakes project was designed to provide irrigation for new agricultural developments, and to attract people to the region and away from the dense populations of the Nile Valley itself. 

The segmentation task is achieved using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery with the PyTorch framework and the U-Net architecture.

## Project Description 

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately identify the water bodies of Toushka Lakes. The segmentation task involves classifying each pixel in satellite imagery as either water or non-water. This information can be valuable for various applications, such as environmental monitoring, water resource management, and urban planning.

The U-Net architecture is chosen for its effectiveness in image segmentation tasks. It consists of an encoder path that captures contextual information and a decoder path that enables precise localization. The PyTorch framework provides a powerful and flexible environment for building and training deep learning models.

## Study Area 

The lakes are natural depressions in the Sahara Desert that are filled by overflow from Lake Nasser, the enormous 550-kilometer-long (340-mile) reservoir built on the Nile River. Lake Nasser appears in the 2021 image (far right).

## Dataset 

The dataset used in this project consists of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. SAR data offers valuable information for waterbodies segmentation due to its ability to penetrate cloud cover and capture images regardless of the weather conditions. The dataset was prepared by preprocessing the SAR imagery and creating four different datasets to facilitate the segmentation task.

1. #### VV Band Dataset
 This dataset contains SAR images with only the VV (Vertical-Vertical) polarization band. The VV band provides valuable information about the backscatter intensity, which is essential for distinguishing waterbodies from surrounding land cover.

### The main challenges encountered during this project included:
1. The similarity of intensity values of water bodies and the surrounding land cover of the desert, always leads to the misclassification of many land pixels as water bodies.
